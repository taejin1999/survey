\section{Summary and Conclusions}


The cost-per-bit of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (i.e., SSDs) has steadily improved through uninterrupted semiconductor process scaling and multi-leveling so that they are how widely employed in not only mobile embedded systems but also personal computing systems.
However, the limited lifetime of NAND flash memory, as a side effect of recent advanced device technologies, is emerging as one of the major concerns for recent high-performance SSDs, especially for datacenter applications.
