Replacing HDDs with NAND flash-based storage devices (SSDs) has been one of the major 
challenges in modern computing systems especially in regards to better performance and higher mobility.
Although uninterrupted semiconductor process scaling and multi-leveling techniques 
lower the price of SSDs to the comparable level of HDDs, the decreasing lifetime of NAND flash memory, 
as a side effect of recent advanced device technologies, 
is emerging as one of the major barriers to the wide adoption of SSDs in high-performance computing systems.

In this dissertation, we argue that cross-layer optimization techniques, which vertically
integrate various optimization factors from different design abstraction levels, can play
key roles in improving the lifetime of high-density NAND flash memory.

We first propose a system-level approach to reduce WAF that exploits
the I/O context of an application to increase the data lifetime prediction
for the multi-streamed SSDs. 
By extracting program contexts during runtime, data-to-stream mapping is done automatically.
Thus, it can effectively separate data with
short lifetimes from on with long lifetimes to improve the efficiency of garbage collection.

Second, present a write traffic reduction approach which reduces the amount of
write traffic sent to a storage by eliminating redundant data, therby improving
the lifetime of storage devices. 
In particular, we improve the likelihood of eliminating redundant data
by introducing sub-page chunk based on the understanding of file system behavior.
It resolves technical difficulties caused by its finer granularity, i.e., increased memory requirement and read
response time. 

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, we performed 
a series of evaluations using both a trace-driven simulator and emulator with I/O
traces which were collected from various real-world systems.
To understand the feasibility of the proposed techniques, we also implemented them
in Linux kernel on top of our in-house flash storage prototype and then evaluated
their effects on the lifetime while running real-world applications.
Our experimental results show that cross-layer optimization techniques are
more effective over single-layer optimization techniques.
